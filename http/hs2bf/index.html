<h1>Introduction</h1>
hs2bf is a <a href="http://haskell.org/">haskell</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfuck</a> compiler. I believe this is the first attempt to write
a compiler that can translate a high-level language such as Haskell to brainfuck.

You can download it from <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs2bf">hackageDB - hs2bf</a>.


<h1>Supported Code</h1>
<h2>Limitation</h2>
no type inference / type annotation: The only primitive type is Byte.<br/>

<h2>I/O</h2>
hs2bf uses special data structure E to represent behavior of an arbitrary brainfuck program.

<pre class="code">
data E=Input (Char -> E)
      |Output Char E
      |Halt

main :: E
</pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>

echo:
<pre class="code">
main=Input (\x->Output x main)
</pre>

hello world:
<pre class="code">
main=outputStr Halt "Hello World!"

outputStr k []=k
outputStr k (x:xs)=Output x (outputStr k xs)
</pre>

quicksort:
<pre class="code">
main=outputStr Halt (qsort "etsb")

qsort []=[]
qsort (x:xs)=qsort (filter (gtByte x) xs)++[x]++qsort (filter (leByte x) xs)

outputStr k []=k
outputStr k (x:xs)=Output x (outputStr k xs)
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, hs2bf supports very powerful subset of Haskell98 syntax.
</p>

<p>
You can find more examples in <a href="http://www.xanxys.net/public/hs2bf-0.5-test.tar.bz2">hs2bf-0.5-test.tar.bz2</a>
(Actually, these files were used for automated regression testing)
</p>

<h1>Overall structure</h1>
(stub)<br/>

3 intermidiate languages, namely Core, GM(G-machine) and SAM(sequntial access machine) are used during compilation.
And GM and SAM have interpreters for debugging.

<h2>Haskell parser</h2>
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src">haskell-src</a> library is used to parse Haskell code.

<h2>Core language</h2>
... is something like this:
<pre class="code">
outputStr #a0 #a1=
    case ((XT2 #a0) #a1) of
        XT2 #xa #xb ->
            let
                k = #xa
            in
                case #xb of
                    XCons   ->
                        let
                            k = #xa
                        in
                            case #xb of
                                XCons #xa #xb ->
                                    let
                                        x = #xa
                                    in
                                        let
                                            xs = #xb
                                        in
                                            ((Output x) ((outputStr k) xs))
                    XNil ->
                        k
</pre>

<h2>G-machine</h2>
reference:
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/">The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages</a>
<br/>

GM code looks like:
<pre class="code">
XT2:
    PushArg 2
    PushArg 2
    Pack 0 2
    Slide 3
</pre>

You should read the paper by SPJ if you haven't.

<h2>Sequential Access Machine</h2>
<p>
This is like an assembly language w/o absolute addressing.
</p>

<p>
Its code consists of procedures which can take fixed number of
arguments.

Its state consists of named memory regions and fixed number of registers,
and a pointer shared among the memory regions.
</p>

Operands of SAM instruction can be either:
<ol>
<li>relative pointer in specified memory region</li>
<li>a register</li>
</ol>

<p>
Registers can be allocated and deallocated dynamically but they can't
be passed across scopes(like variables in C). This pseudo "deallocation" is
implemented to ease code generation.
</p>

<pre class="code">
S0 H0

pr #heapRef/addr
    val addr -1
    while addr
        val addr -1
        alloc cnt
        copy $H0 cnt
        while cnt
            val cnt -1
            locate 1
        delete cnt
</pre>

<p>
The first line "S0 H0" declares memory regions which are available throughout the code.
</p>

<p>
"pr #heapRef/addr" defined a procedure "#heapRef" which takes one argument "addr".
</p>

<p>
"val addr -1" decrements the value of addr modulo 256.
</p>

<p>
"locate 1" moves the current pointer forward by one, and this will affect
memory reference like "$H0".
</p>
 


<h1>Runtime System</h1>

<h2>Memory Layout</h2>


<h3>Basic Mechanism</h3>
<p>
Raw brainfuck memory space is <span class="code">Nat->Byte</span>.
So you can combine N such memory spaces <span class="code">[Nat->Byte]</span> by interleaving them.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this, you'll need registers to carry values around since brainfuck doesn't support absolute
addressing. If you want M registers, you can create N+M memory spaces with the previous method and
move values in M memory spaces everytime you modify the pointer.
</p>




<h3>Actual Implementation</h3>
<img src="memory.png" alt="memory mapping"/>

<p>
As of now, hs2bf uses 3 memory spaces S0,H0 and H1. S0 is used for stack of heap node ids,
and H0 and H1 are two heaps in a copying garbage collection.
</p>

<p>
A node is a variable size structure which ids starting from 1. Address 0 of the stack is marked 0,
so it is always possible to return to address 0 wherever you are.
</p>

heap node structure:
<pre>
1B: node size
1B: "reachable" flag (for garbage collection, 0 means unreachable from the root, 1 means otherwise)
1B: node type
*B: payload
1B: node id
1B: node size
</pre>



<h2>State Machine</h2>
<img src="states.png" alt="finite state machine"/><br/>

Since you can't "call" a function, the procedure call is represented by one huge "dispatch" sentence
which encompasses all procedures.




<h1>brainfuck specific techniques</h1>

<h2>"if" sentence</h2>
<p>
"if v>0 then XXX" is easily realized by <span class="code">[[-]XXX]</span>, assuming v is currently referred by
the pointer.
</p>

<p>
A little bit diffucult problem is "if v==0 then XXX", and this can be done through negation.
For example, let a temporary variable u be 1, and execute "if v>0 then u--; if u>0 then XXX".
</p>






<h2>comparison of numbers</h2>
Suppose you have two numbers <span class="code">x,y :: Byte</span>, and you want to compare them.

<h3>equality</h3>
Decrement both x and y until x becomes 0, and check if y is 0.

<h3>oredering</h3>
If there's a way to subtract <span class="code">min x y</span> from <span class="code">x,y</span>,
then you can tell which one's larger than (or equal to) the other. 

So the problem of comparing two numbers is reduced to logical operations which can be done by nested if.
But there's a more complex and faster way.


<h2>expansion of "switch" sentence in SAM</h2>
The following code:
<pre class="code">
dispatch f
    0
        X
    1
        Y
    2
        Z
</pre>

can be expanded to:
<pre class="code">
clr 1 t
while f
    val 1 f -1
    dispatch f
        0
            Y
        1
            Z
    clr 1 t
    val 1 t +1
while t
    X
    clr 1 t
</pre>

and to:
<pre class="code">
clr 1 t
while f
    val 1 f -1
    clr 1 t
    while f
        val 1 f -1
        Z
        clr 1 t
        val 1 t +1
    while t
        Y
        clr 1 t
    clr 1 t
    val 1 t +1
while t
    X
    clr 1 t
</pre>

This expansion method can be applied recursively.


<h2>addition w/ carry</h2>
eg. Addition of x,y::Byte.
if x &lt; x+y &amp;&amp; y &lt; x+y, then there's no carry.
