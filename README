The whole site is provisioned with git, except for /public.

/public is add-only blob store, and its master data is on AWS S3.
Files inside public shouldn't be deleted, modified. And they should not
be included in git; Avoid putting text or source code without version specifier.

Other part of the site is considered mutable, and managed by git (master is
bitbucket).
